This is GSI project, patches based on the Phh's and Andy Yan works

apply-patches.sh to apply all patches
	ex. usage:
	cd /where/bootleggers/sources
	bash ~/files/patches/bootleggers/v223/apply-patches.sh ~/files/patches/bootleggers/v223/

buildqiDroid.sh for starting build process from zero
	ex. usage:
	cd ~/files/patches/bootleggers/v223

Patches separated to the three category:
bootleg - specific fixes to adapt BootleggersROM for GSI (partially based on Andy's patches)
generic - Phh's patches, some of them adapted for BootleggersROM
personal - my personal additional tweaks & fixes (for qiDroid Project)
